--- Shader-replacement effects.
---
--- The reference game draws editions (foil/holo/polychrome), the gold seal shine and the
--- score flames with GLSL fragment shaders. The PICA200 has no programmable fragment
--- stage, and the 3DS runtime exposes exactly one texture-combiner configuration —
--- texel x vertex colour (`platform/ctr/include/utilities/driver/vertex_ext.hpp` in
--- LövePotion) — plus framebuffer blend modes. This module re-expresses those shaders
--- with the two levers that do exist:
---
---  * Per-vertex colours on a `love.graphics.newMesh` strip, Gouraud-interpolated by
---    the GPU. Texture filtering is forced NEAREST on the 3DS, so a gradient texture
---    would band; vertex interpolation does not go through the sampler and stays smooth.
---  * A second additive pass of the same texture. The runtime's `add` blend multiplies
---    source by its own alpha, so the art's transparent rounded corners mask the
---    overlay to the card silhouette with no stencil (stencil is unreachable on ctr).
---
--- Mesh texcoords on the ctr backend are only V-flipped, never rescaled, and sample the
--- physical (power-of-two padded) texture. `Image:getDimensions()` reports the *source*
--- size on hardware — a t3x carries the padded size in `width_log2`/`height_log2` and the
--- source size in its subtexture header, and LövePotion reads the latter
--- (`t3xhandler.cpp:51`) — so mesh UVs must divide by the padded size, not the reported
--- one. Quads get that rescale for free (`texture_ext.cpp:291`); meshes do not.
---
--- `Mesh:setVertices` is a Balatro3DS runtime binding (dev/patch_lovepotion.py) —
--- upstream ctr never implemented it. Every animated pass rewrites one cached mesh per
--- vertex count instead of allocating a fresh Mesh; the vertex tables are pooled too,
--- so the steady state of a pass is allocation-free on the Lua side.

-- The interference field

-- Holo and polychrome both rotate hue through the same three-part field
-- (`holo.fs:105-118`, `polychrome.fs:110-123`) at different scales: 250 for holo's
-- fine grain, 50 for polychrome's large slow blobs.
--
-- Every card on screen samples it at the same instant, so it is built once per frame
-- into a shared table rather than per card. That is what makes the dense grid
-- affordable on an Old 3DS: the per-card cost drops to a table read plus a hue lookup,
-- within ~1 us of the flat version it replaces. Per-card variety comes from a scalar
-- hue offset instead of the reference's per-card seed, which is free.
--
-- The field's own divisors are 143/99/53 seconds, so it drifts far slower than the
-- frame rate; rebuilding at FIELD_HZ rather than every frame is invisible and takes
-- the shared cost to a fifth.

-- reads every vertex across the Lua/C boundary one component at a time (nine rawgets
-- and six number checks each, mirroring `wrap_graphics.cpp:1594-1641`), every animated

-- Edition vertex colours
--
-- Each edition is a base pass (multiplies the art) and an additive pass (light the
-- card gives off). The additive pass samples either the art again or, where the

-- sheet whose alpha carries the structure (see dev/bake_edition_patterns.py).
-- u/v are 0..1 across the cell.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Foil is an *overlay*, not a repaint. The reference draws the card normally through
-- `dissolve` and only then draws `foil` over the top (`card.lua:4459-4464`), and
-- `foil.fs:129` caps that overlay's alpha at `0.3*tex.a + 0.9*min(0.5, maxfac*0.1)` --
-- so off the ridges the foil layer is 30% opaque and nothing more. Compositing the
-- reference's own overlay colour (`tex.rgb - delta` on red and green, blue untouched,
-- `foil.fs:126-128`) at that 30% over a mid-tone card lands on roughly a
-- (0.72, 0.70, 1.00) multiply of the art.
--
-- This port has no second layer to spare -- the base pass *is* the card draw -- so the

--
-- Driving a full-circle hue at the strength this port used made holo read as a rainbow,

-- Dissolve / materialize
--
-- The reference does not shrink or fade a card that is being destroyed or created.
-- `Card:start_dissolve` and `Card:start_materialize` (`reference/Balatro/card.lua:2130`,
-- `:2183`) only ease a scalar `dissolve` — 0 to 1 over 0.7 s, or 1 to 0 over 0.6 s,
-- linearly (`engine/event.lua:70`, ease type `lerp`) — and every sprite layer is then
-- drawn through `dissolve.fs` with that value. The card stays at full size and full
-- opacity throughout; what the player sees is entirely the shader.
--
-- Three things happen in it, and all three survive the trip to a fragment-stage-less
-- GPU because `Fx.build_grid` already gives per-vertex colour over an image cell:
--
--  * The art lerps toward a burn colour, `tex.rgb*(1-0.6*d) + 0.6*burn.rgb*d`
--    (`dissolve.fs:59-65`). Split here into a greyscale multiply on the base pass and
--    an additive pass, the same two-pass shape every edition already uses.
--  * A per-pixel noise value is thresholded against `d`, so pixels drop out in noise
--    order (`dissolve.fs:36-41`). The field is the same three-part interference field
--    holo and polychrome use — `build_field` is shared — but sampled at a time that is
--    a per-card constant (`sprite.lua:100` feeds it `123.33412*(ID/1.14212)%3000`), so
--    unlike the edition fields it never moves. That is what makes this cheap: the field
--    is built once per variant per grid size and cached forever, and a frame only
--    thresholds it.
--  * The threshold front is coloured. Pixels just above the cut take `burn_colour_1`,
--    a wider band behind them takes `burn_colour_2` (`dissolve.fs:44-50`).
--
-- Two deliberate divergences. The shader's cut is per-pixel and hard; Gouraud gives a
-- soft front about one grid cell wide (~18 px at grid 4 on a 71 px card), which
-- EDGE_SHARPNESS tightens as far as vertex interpolation allows. And the shader
-- normalizes both texture axes by the larger one before testing the 0.2/0.8 border
-- margins, so on a 71x95 cell the right-hand margin is never reached and the card burns
-- in from three sides; each axis is normalized by its own extent here, so the burn is
-- symmetric.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- What the mask can and cannot be on this hardware, decided by measurement rather than taste.
--
-- The base game cuts per pixel, so its holes have smooth curved outlines. Three ways to get a
-- per-pixel cut on a PICA200 were checked and all three are closed: there is no programmable
-- fragment stage; `C3D_AlphaTest` is never bound by LovePotion on ctr (only the Wii U backend
-- calls the equivalent, `platform/cafe/.../renderer_ext.cpp:56`); and stencil appears on ctr
-- only in render-target plumbing, which is moot because canvases do not render there at all.
-- So the outline has to be built out of geometry, and the only question is which geometry.
--
-- Flat hard-edged tiles were tried and are worse than the problem they solved. A tile is honest
-- per-pixel-style masking at tile resolution, but resolution is exactly what is scarce:
-- vertices are the binding cost (`wrap_graphics.cpp:1594-1641` - `setVertices` crosses the
-- Lua/C boundary nine times per vertex), and a tile grid fine enough to trace a curve needs
-- thousands of them. At an affordable 8x10 the card came apart into 9 px blocks, which reads as
-- a mosaic filter rather than as burning.
--
-- An interpolated grid spends its vertices better. The alpha = 0.5 contour of a Gouraud grid is
-- a polyline through the cells, so it *curves* - the edge is placed to sub-cell precision even
-- though the samples are not. That is the right trade at 240p: a curved edge one cell soft
-- looks far more like the shader than a hard edge nine pixels square. What went wrong the first
-- time round was not interpolation, it was resolution - at grid 8 with a field cut down to one
-- blob per card, isolated single-sample survivors were common and each one interpolates into a
-- diamond. A grid fine enough to resolve the field turns those into connected regions with
-- curved boundaries, which is what `test_fx.lua` now measures directly.
-- Chosen by eye against the shader running side by side, at grid 16. 154 puts six or seven
-- separate holes in the card at mid-tween and takes the measured front to 4.6 px.
local DISSOLVE_FIELD_SPAN = 154

-- of animated editions already spends every frame. This is affordable precisely because a

-- the tuning had no headroom in it. Dropping a step during a crowd is the cheap half of the
-- answer: grid 16 to 10 is 574 vertices a pass down to 238, and grid 10 to 8 is 238 down to
-- 158. What it costs is contour resolution on the burn front, which is precisely what nobody
-- can look at while five cards are burning in on a 240p screen - and the moment the crowd
-- thins the fine grid comes back, so the dissolve a player actually watches is unchanged.
